After you download the files, open the file 'users.py' in 'modules/users' in edit, navigate to Line 6, Colon 10 and change 'paths = ""' to your Folder Directory, also ensure your Folder Directory is changed inside 'data.json' in 'data' and 'CopyFiles/This PC/Local Disk/data.json' change them to the Folder Directory on your pc (e.x, C:\Users\disgu\Documents\Projects\Python\PythonOS)
